# Report part for bank workload

## Bank tests
A transactional workload that is often used to test consistency of a database is the bank test. In a bank test mony transfers between bank accounts are simulated. For these transactions it is of course important that there is no mony lost during transfer. Moreover bank accounts have the simple constraint that they are not allowed to have a negative amount in the bank.

### Requirements
A bank account could be represented as an integer. A transaction must be atomic. For a mony transfer, mony needs to be subtracted from one account and then added to another one. If there is a failure half way the transaction should roll back. Otherwise mony will be lost. In order for the account to be nonnegative a constraint must be added in the transaction that if the transfer amount is less than the bank account the transaction should fail.

### Cassandra guarantees
The question is: does cassandra give sufficient transactional guaranties to implement the bank test. Using ```batch```, ```counter``` and light weight transactions (```ltw```) as building blocks is should be possible to build a bank test with mony transfer. 

The ```batch``` statement [guarantees atomicity](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.x/cql/cql_reference/cqlBatch.html). the ```counter``` datatype supports [addition and subtracting](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.x/cql/cql_reference/counter_type.html). Finally, using ```ltw``` a [compare and set operation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/python/3.2/lwt.html) allows us to check if there is enough mony in the account for a transfer. 

Create the following table: 
```sql
CREATE TABLE test.t (
    pid int PRIMARY KEY,
    value counter
)
```
Then combining the three building blocks gives our potential bank transfer:

```clojure
 (defn transfer [from, to, amount] 
    (str "BEGIN COUNTER BATCH "
    "UPDATE bat SET value = value + " amount " WHERE pid = " from "; "
    "UPDATE bat SET value = value - " amount " WHERE pid = " to 
        "IF value > "amount";"
    "APPLY BATCH;" ))
```
However running this query gives an error unfortunatly:

>Conditions on counters are not supported

And if we look closer in Cassandras [cql documentation for counter batch](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/cql/dml.html#counter-batches) we see that counters are not [idempotent](https://docs.datastax.com/en/glossary/docs/index.html#idempotent). Cassandra uses (a modified version) of Paxos for compare and set. If a Paxos round fails to commit the operation will be replayed next round but replaying a counter addition would result in a new value. Light weight transactions only support idempotent data types.

So we drop the constraint that bank accounts have to be non-negative an proceed with the test. We can still expect no mony to be lost in the transfer.
